//~~~~~~~REDUX MEMORIAL~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

//Here lies a few days of sweat and tears as I was learning to construct my first use of redux from scratch. It was a good run. The ol girl did what she was supposed to do but alas was replaced by her betrayer useContext. Here she will remain as proof that I did indeed conquer, the beatiful yet confounding mistress redux.

// import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

// export const wordSlice = createSlice({
//   name: "word",
//   initialState: {
//     saidWord: '',
//   },
//   reducers: {
//     update: (state, action) => {
//       state.saidWord = action.payload.saidWord;
//     },
//     remove: (state) => {
//       state.saidWord = null;
//     },
//   },
// })

// export const { update, remove } = wordSlice.actions

// export default wordSlice.reducer
