#### ideas

* say it match it - word spelled is shown for a few seconds - three words similar are shown user picks correct one (creates association with spoken word to how its spelled) (dictionary api?)
* padomonium - flock of parrots - 
* spoken calculator - fun to say a problem ie 10 - 5 and see it shown as spoken - user can then associate what 10 looks like creates a visual memory for the numbers
