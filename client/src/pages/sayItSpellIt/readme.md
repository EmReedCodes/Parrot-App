### does not

* not sure yet

# my notes
* Do I need to immediately save the word to db? No but I will want to hold onto a copy of the complete word before its sliced
* So I want user to speak a word hold that word in a variable the user can not see so the transcript
* Ensure just a single word for now probably [0]
